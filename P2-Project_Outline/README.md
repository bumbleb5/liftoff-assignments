## Submission Instructions

### Overview
One of my most memorable July 4ths was spent on the road, while Alex and I helped two dogs, who were pulled from Witchita Animal Control with hours 
to spare, make their way from Independence, MO to their new home in New Jersey. The entire operation was organized between strangers on Facebook Messenger
and could not have been possible without every single person involved. It was also a great headache and I spent a considerable amount of time coordinating
the trip while I was supposed to be working, chatting back and forth between various individuals and rescues.

My application, PuppyCab, will help to unite those volunteers and provide an effortless organization experience for the transport coordinator. With 
PuppyCab, organizers can input a pet's location and destination or choose from Petfinder pets and a Google Maps widget calculates the pet's route with
volunteers near the route placed on the map. The coordinator can then choose volunteers to add to the transport; they can also view scheduled transports and
a list of their organization's volunteers. 

Features:
- List of pets from Petfinder: Users will be able to select a pet from Petfinder or alternatively input a custom location.
- Google Map widget: Users can view the pet's routes and see volunteers near the route.
- Volunteer Dashboard: Users can view all of the volunteers associated with their organization and their information.
- Transport Dashboard: Users can view scheduled transports assocaited with thier organization.
